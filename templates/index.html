            <p> MI district and school demographics warehouse is an api set up to help the public undestand the demographic breakdown
            of MI schools and districts, as well as related information about resources and socioeconomic status. The data is free to use
            and may be helpful for people looking to research the recent history of the school system, or build dashboards related to equity 
            in education. The financial data found at this API is taken from the US Census Bureau by way of a 
            <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/noriuk/us-education-datasets-unification-project'>Kaggle dataset</a>. The numbers 
            are from 2016. Some processing was done on the metrics to normalize financial figures to the number of students in district. The 
            school demograpics data was scraped from a look up tool on 
            <a href = 'https://www.mlive.com/news/2017/01/see_the_racial_composition_of.html'> Mlive</a>. This data is from 2017.

            <h3 class = 'text-center'>Instructions for Developers</h3>
            <p > This api is quite straightforward to use. Simply put in the URL for the data you want. We do not require an api key. Most keys in our JSONs
                are self explanatory, but financial data is normalized to enrollment so "fed_rev_per_s" is federal revenue per student, and all financial statements 
                are reported in thousands of dollars. Each JSON is structured as an object with a single key, which gives a list of objects. 
                There is one object for every school or district.  </p>
